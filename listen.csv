Questions,"You went to the party, even though I explicitly told you not to?",0,en,gt_audios/0.wav
Questions,"So, just so I'm absolutely certain I understand this, you did in fact go to the party, despite me explicitly telling you not to, correct? And you genuinely, hand-on-heart, believed that was appropriate behavior, did you? What part of 'no' was unclear to you then? This isn't just about defiance, it's about a fundamental lack of respect. Do you even realize the implications of what you've done?",3,en,gt_audios/3.wav
Questions,There is another aircraft still in the air???,0,en,gt_audios/4.wav
Questions,"Just a moment, you're not genuinely suggesting there's another aircraft unaccounted for, are you? And we're still completely in the dark about its purpose? Seriously, what on earth are the standing orders now? And perhaps more critically, what's our immediate fallback if those directives prove insufficient?",3,en,gt_audios/7.wav
Questions,"Now, seriously, you're saying I am the one to blame?",0,en,gt_audios/8.wav
Questions,"Okay, fine. So, let's imagine for a second I even consider that. After all that's happened, you're still trying to tell me I'm the one solely to blame? And if that's the case, what exactly do you propose I should have done differently then? And do you honestly, truly, expect me to just accept that without any further discussion? So, what's the actual plan then, if that's your final word?",3,en,gt_audios/11.wav
Questions,But she clearly doesn't want to?,0,en,gt_audios/12.wav
Questions,"I mean, seriously now, are we truly just going to stand here and pretend we don't see that she clearly, unequivocally doesn't want to? And if, as seems blindingly obvious, she genuinely feels that way, what conceivable justification is there for even contemplating proceeding? Are we completely missing something fundamental here? Or is the collective silence meant to imply something else entirely?",3,en,gt_audios/15.wav
Questions,To Hungary and back?,0,en,gt_audios/16.wav
Questions,"Really, to Hungary and back, just like that? Wow. That genuinely sounds like quite an adventure, almost a whirlwind. So, I'm curious, did you actually manage to pick up any usable Hungarian, you know, beyond the absolute basics? Or was it a case of everyone there just speaking perfect English, making it almost too easy? And if it was mostly English, did you ever feel like you missed out on a deeper connection because of it?",3,en,gt_audios/19.wav
Questions,You're a copper?,0,en,gt_audios/20.wav
Questions,"Hang on a second, are you genuinely trying to convince me you're a police officer, right now? And if, by some bizarre chance, that's the case, what on earth could possibly drag you, of all people, to my perfectly ordinary cul-de-sac at this hour, I'm dying to know? Or, and I'm just spitballing here, have you perhaps got the wrong street entirely? Because this whole situation is feeling rather peculiar, wouldn't you agree?",3,en,gt_audios/23.wav
Questions,"What is Data Informed Diplomacy, with all its various manifestations?",0,en,gt_audios/24.wav
Questions,"Look, I understand the general idea, perhaps, but specifically, what on earth is Data Informed Diplomacy, with all these touted 'various manifestations'? And how, in any truly meaningful way, does it actually distinguish itself from long-standing diplomatic methods? Moreover, are we genuinely, hand-on-heart, convinced it consistently achieves demonstrably better outcomes, or is there a significant element of wishful thinking involved here? And who exactly is verifying these 'better outcomes,' and by what unbiased metrics are they even being measured, if at all?",3,en,gt_audios/27.wav
Questions,"What's really happening, and is there more than meets the eye?",0,en,gt_audios/28.wav
Questions,"Look, I'm really starting to feel uneasy, like what precisely is unfolding here, and truly, could there be something much deeper going on that we're oblivious to? Because if so, shouldn't our collective concern be, well, escalating rather sharply? Or am I perhaps reading too much into all of this? And if I'm not overthinking it, then shouldn't we be demanding some answers, like, right now?",3,en,gt_audios/31.wav
Questions,How on earth is this Financial Report organized?,0,en,gt_audios/32.wav
Questions,"Pardon my persistence, but I am truly finding it challenging to understand, how precisely is this Financial Report structured? Is there some guiding principle to its organization that I'm just not perceiving, despite looking carefully? Or, and I hesitate to ask this, could it be that its complexity is an intentional feature for some specific purpose? And if the latter is true, what would be the reasoning behind such a design choice?",3,en,gt_audios/35.wav
Questions,Where has Jason Abhisheki moved all the flowers to?,0,en,gt_audios/36.wav
Questions,"Wait, seriously, where on earth has Jason Abhisheki moved all the flowers to? And why wasn't I told about this? And is anyone going to do anything about it? Honestly, this whole situation is beyond frustrating. Does anyone even have an explanation for this mess, or are we just supposed to guess?",3,en,gt_audios/39.wav
Questions,"What do we do in this situation, and what are the implications for Jordan's water supply?",0,en,gt_audios/40.wav
Questions,"Frankly, and I truly need a clear answer on this, what exactly are we even planning to do about this rapidly escalating crisis, and what, in truly concrete terms, will be the direct consequences for Jordan's already critically strained water supply? Moreover, and this is where my concern deepens, is there genuinely a viable backup plan if – or, let's be realistic, when – our current strategies prove insufficient? Or are we, almost unbelievably, just hoping for the best without any concrete contingencies whatsoever? And if that is indeed the unsettling reality, how precisely do we intend to manage public expectation and prevent widespread panic when the inevitable occurs?",3,en,gt_audios/43.wav
Questions,"But the Brexit question remains: After all the trials and tribulations, will the ministers find the answers in time?",0,en,gt_audios/44.wav
Questions,"Honestly, the Brexit question still looms large, doesn't it—almost unbelievably so: after all these protracted trials and frankly exhausting tribulations, can we, in all seriousness, expect the ministers to conjure up the right answers in time? Or is this just another, shall we say, predictable exercise in kicking the can further down the road, hoping against hope for a miracle? And if that's the case, what's the actual endgame here, if any? The official statements offer little clarity, frankly, and provide no concrete timelines. So, amidst all this ambiguity, are citizens supposed to simply wait indefinitely for a resolution that may never materialize?",3,en,gt_audios/47.wav
Questions,"Sorry, can you restate your name and address please?",0,en,gt_audios/48.wav
Questions,"My sincerest apologies, truly, and I do appreciate your patience, but I seem to still be finding it exceptionally difficult to catch everything you're saying clearly; would you mind terribly restating your full name and complete address for me, if you please, perhaps speaking a little more slowly? And then, could you very patiently spell out the street name, letter by letter, to guarantee I capture it accurately this time, every single detail? And just to be absolutely, definitively certain, is there any specific apartment or unit number I should include? After all that, would you also be able to provide a contact number, just in case there are any issues with locating the address later on?",3,en,gt_audios/51.wav
Questions,"Here's the full story for today, would you like to learn more?",0,en,gt_audios/52.wav
Questions,"Okay, so, just to be perfectly clear, here's the full story for today, but are you absolutely sure you'd like to learn more? I mean, it genuinely, and I'm not exaggerating, contains some rather unexpected twists towards the end. Seriously now, are you fully prepared for what might be quite a few, shall we say, significant surprises? Because if you're not quite in the mood for that, and that's entirely understandable, we could always pick something else, couldn't we? Wouldn't a different narrative perhaps be more relaxing for today?",3,en,gt_audios/55.wav
Questions,"Mr. Chairman, your highly anticipated interview with Channel 4 has turned into a catastrophe, hasn't it?",0,en,gt_audios/56.wav
Questions,"Mr. Chairman, if I may be so bold, one is almost forced to ask, given the undeniably grim outcome, your much-publicized interview with Channel 4 has unfortunately, and quite spectacularly, backfired into a significant catastrophe, hasn't it? And considering the immediate and widespread public fallout, what concrete, decisive actions are being actively pursued to mitigate this escalating damage? Furthermore, could you clarify if a formal internal review is also underway? And, crucially, will the findings of such a review, assuming it confirms the widespread perception of failure, be made transparently available to stakeholders and the public?",3,en,gt_audios/59.wav
Questions,"Johnny boy, don't go around acting tough if you can't back it up, right?",0,en,gt_audios/60.wav
Questions,"So, let me get this straight, Johnny boy, you're actually suggesting it's a sound tactic to strut around with a tough facade when you have zero ability to support it; is that the profound wisdom you're imparting? And then, what exactly, in your grand estimation, does this posturing achieve? Do you sincerely imagine this performance commands any real admiration, or could it be, just possibly, that it paints you as rather absurd? And you still don't see the inherent flaw in that entire line of reasoning, do you?",3,en,gt_audios/63.wav
Questions,Are you in favor of the Latex usage policy or you're just sucking up to leadership?,0,en,gt_audios/64.wav
Questions,"Okay, look, just be absolutely straight with me for a moment, will you?: are you genuinely in favor of this whole Latex usage policy, or are you, perhaps, just trying to stay on leadership's good side, as one does? Because if it's the former, and frankly I'm having a hard time believing that, what on earth is the supposed big advantage that we're all conveniently overlooking, hmm? Honestly, I am utterly failing to see any conceivable upside myself, so could you please attempt to enlighten me on what that compelling reason might possibly be? And even if there is such a reason, how are we supposed to sell this to everyone else who's just as confused?",3,en,gt_audios/67.wav
Questions,"Is it a bird, or is it a plane?",0,en,gt_audios/68.wav
Questions,"Hang on, no, seriously, tell me, is that really supposed to be just a bird, or could it, by some utterly impossible chance, be a plane? And more importantly, why in the entire world is it hurtling straight at us like this? Are we in immediate, undeniable danger here? And what is anyone proposing we actually do about it?",3,en,gt_audios/71.wav
Questions,"Madam, have you tried turning it off and on again?",0,en,gt_audios/72.wav
Questions,"Madam, I appreciate your patience, and I must re-emphasize this, though it sounds deceptively simple: are you entirely, one hundred percent confident that you, yourself, executed a full power cycle – off, then on again? And following that, can you state with absolute certainty that the device remained completely inert, no power at all, for no less than, shall we stipulate, a verified thirty seconds before you initiated the restart? If these conditions were meticulously met, what then, precisely, was the status of any illumination from the device itself? And, just as importantly, did you happen to notice any on-screen messages or hear any unusual sounds at that specific juncture?",3,en,gt_audios/75.wav
Questions,Were you the one with the hand-held camera or the one with a weird-looking android phone?,0,en,gt_audios/76.wav
Questions,"Look, I need to be sure about this: were you the one with the hand-held camera, or—and think carefully now—were you perhaps the person with that, well, let's just say, unmistakable android phone? And more importantly, what precisely did you manage to record with it, assuming you recorded anything at all? Because, frankly, the clarity of such a recording could completely change our understanding of the incident. So, tell me, are you planning to submit it as evidence? Or should we proceed under the assumption that no such recording exists?",3,en,gt_audios/79.wav
Questions,Don't you think it's a bit too late to start now?,0,en,gt_audios/80.wav
Questions,"I mean, honestly, don't you think it's a bit too late to start now? Shouldn't we perhaps regroup and assess the situation before committing further resources? Is there any compelling new information that justifies this sudden push? We've already invested so much time and energy with limited results. Given that, are we truly prepared for another potential setback if this doesn't pan out?",3,en,gt_audios/83.wav
Questions,Isn't this view absolutely breathtaking?,0,en,gt_audios/84.wav
Questions,"Okay, honestly, isn't this view just so overwhelmingly breathtaking, almost to the point of being unreal? And surely you'd agree this light elevates it to something truly magical, wouldn't you? But where should we even begin to try and capture all this beauty? Will words or pictures ever actually do it justice, do you suppose?",3,en,gt_audios/87.wav
Questions,"After everything that happened, can we really just pretend it's okay?",0,en,gt_audios/88.wav
Questions,"So, let me get this straight: after all of this, we're supposed to, what, just conveniently forget everything? And then, are we meant to just cheerfully proceed as if not one iota was out of place? Is that honestly the game plan, or am I utterly failing to grasp the logic here? And, realistically, how long can such a pretense even be maintained before it all unravels?",3,en,gt_audios/91.wav
Questions,What if we simply postponed the decision until next week?,0,en,gt_audios/92.wav
Questions,"Okay, I hear the arguments for urgency, but honestly, considering the sheer magnitude of uncertainties we're currently wrestling with, couldn't we perhaps just consider postponing the decision until next week? Wouldn't that, realistically, alleviate at least a portion of this intense immediate pressure everyone's so clearly under? Or is there some truly overriding factor I'm completely failing to grasp that makes immediate action utterly unavoidable? And if we don't postpone, what are the specific, measurable benefits we expect to gain this week that unequivocally outweigh the risks of rushing?",3,en,gt_audios/95.wav
Questions,Who in their right mind would approve such a ridiculous plan?,0,en,gt_audios/96.wav
Questions,"Seriously now, just to be absolutely clear, who in their actual right mind would approve such a demonstrably ridiculous plan? It completely defies all logic, truly it does. Are we genuinely expected to just accept this without any further explanation, as if it's perfectly normal? Or will someone, anyone, step up and demand a sensible alternative before we all suffer the consequences? And how long are we supposed to wait for this 'sensible alternative' to magically appear, hmm?",3,en,gt_audios/99.wav
Questions,Are you seriously telling me the entire system crashed again?!,0,en,gt_audios/100.wav
Questions,"Excuse me, but am I to understand that the entire system has indeed malfunctioned yet again?! And will there be any official communication regarding the expected downtime this time? Furthermore, is there a dedicated team even looking into preventing these repeated issues? Our patience is wearing incredibly thin with these constant disruptions. Is there any actual commitment to a permanent solution, or should we start considering alternatives?",3,en,gt_audios/103.wav
Questions,Could you possibly tell me where the nearest post office is?,0,en,gt_audios/104.wav
Questions,"Oh dear, honestly, I'm so terribly, terribly sorry to pester you again, I truly am, but my memory is just utterly dreadful today and I simply must be absolutely certain... could you perhaps, please, pretty please, just one more time, tell me exactly where the nearest post office is? And you're absolutely, completely sure that one's open this afternoon, aren't you? And if, by some truly awful tiny chance, it wasn't, what on earth would be the alternative then, I wonder? And would that alternative be reasonably close by, do you suppose?",3,en,gt_audios/107.wav
Questions,I wonder if they received the invitation we sent last Tuesday?,0,en,gt_audios/108.wav
Questions,"You know, I really must say, I'm genuinely starting to worry quite a bit if they actually received that invitation we sent out last Tuesday, it's truly been ages. And if, for some baffling reason, they didn't, what on earth do you propose our next step should be then? Or do you honestly think we should just keep waiting, hoping they'll eventually get back to us? Don't you think we at least owe it to ourselves to explore other avenues at this point?",3,en,gt_audios/111.wav
Questions,"Which colour do you think complements the room better, the blue or the green?",0,en,gt_audios/112.wav
Questions,"Okay, look, honestly, after all this seemingly endless deliberation, I'm still fundamentally torn: which colour do you genuinely, deep down, feel best complements the room, the calming blue or the vibrant green? And are we absolutely one hundred percent certain that yellow is definitively off the table? Because if it's not, for goodness sake, shouldn't we at least quickly look at some swatches? Or, perhaps, are we just overthinking the entire thing from the start?",3,en,gt_audios/115.wav
Questions,Whose signature is required on the bottom of this form?,0,en,gt_audios/116.wav
Questions,"Forgive me, I'm still thoroughly confused by all this, and to ensure I don't make a mistake, could you confirm whose signature is actually mandated for the bottom of this form? And then, regarding my own signature, would that be sufficient, or must it absolutely be from someone with specific authority? Moreover, if it is someone else, who exactly would that be? And, perhaps you could also tell me if there's a specific department I should consult for this particular requirement?",3,en,gt_audios/119.wav
Questions,"So, what happens after we submit the final report?",0,en,gt_audios/120.wav
Questions,"Honestly, concerning what happens after we submit the final report—and I must emphasize, we're all becoming quite apprehensive and really need to clarify the next steps—is there truly a clearly defined standard timeline for review, or is it more the case that it just tends to vary unpredictably depending on the project? And, look, just so we can properly manage our expectations, will there absolutely be some kind of formal acknowledgement of receipt once it's submitted? And if there are unforeseen hold-ups, what's the suggested protocol for us to inquire about the status?",3,en,gt_audios/123.wav
Questions,And you expect me to believe that flimsy excuse?,0,en,gt_audios/124.wav
Questions,"Really now, after all that, you still expect me to believe such a flimsy excuse? Is that genuinely the best you can come up with? Or are you just hoping I'm too tired to argue? Honestly, your reasoning is becoming quite insulting. So, what's the real story here?",3,en,gt_audios/127.wav
Questions,"He finished the project on time, didn't he?",0,en,gt_audios/128.wav
Questions,"Okay, so, apparently, he actually finished the project on time, didn't he? And, if that's true, did he somehow manage to get all the sign-offs before the deadline too? So, then, what's the real story here, because that sounds almost too good to be true? Are you absolutely positive there isn't some catch involved?",3,en,gt_audios/131.wav
Questions,"She hasn't called back yet, has she?",0,en,gt_audios/132.wav
Questions,"Honestly, she still hasn't called back, has she? I mean, it's completely unlike her to just vanish without a word. Are you absolutely sure we shouldn't be trying to contact, say, her sister or even her workplace by now? What else could we possibly do at this point? Frankly, I'm running out of explanations for her behavior. Do you think there's any chance she simply lost her phone and can't contact anyone?",3,en,gt_audios/135.wav
Questions,"You wouldn't happen to have a spare charger, would you?",0,en,gt_audios/136.wav
Questions,"Excuse me, I am so terribly sorry to interrupt, and I know this is an absolutely enormous ask, but you couldn't possibly have a spare charger, could you, by some miracle? And if, by some chance, that's not possible, would you have any idea at all where I might quickly find one around here? Is there a convenience store or an electronics shop anywhere nearby, perhaps? Would it be too much trouble to point me in the right direction if you do know of a place?",3,en,gt_audios/139.wav
Questions,Why on earth did you leave the door unlocked all night?,0,en,gt_audios/140.wav
Questions,"Honestly, I'm baffled, why on earth did you leave the door unlocked all night? And weren't you even a little bit worried? What were you thinking, if anything? This kind of carelessness is just unbelievable. Do you even understand the potential danger you put us in?",3,en,gt_audios/143.wav
Questions,What is this peculiar object made of?,0,en,gt_audios/144.wav
Questions,"What is this peculiar object made of? It really seems to defy conventional classification, doesn't it? So, I'm genuinely wondering, do you have even the slightest theory about its origin? Could it be something entirely unknown to science? That possibility alone is quite staggering. Should we even be handling it without more precautions?",3,en,gt_audios/147.wav
Questions,Who were you talking to on the phone just now?,0,en,gt_audios/148.wav
Questions,"Alright, let's be direct here, I must ask: who exactly were you talking to on the phone just then, and what, if you'd enlighten me, made that whole conversation sound so incredibly secretive? Because, to be perfectly honest, it's got me wondering, should I actually be deeply concerned about this? Or are you planning on keeping me completely in the dark?",3,en,gt_audios/151.wav
Questions,For whom are these elaborate preparations being made?,0,en,gt_audios/152.wav
Questions,"Goodness, seriously now, for whom exactly are these elaborate preparations being made? The entire hall is decked out, practically unrecognizable. Are we genuinely expecting royalty, perhaps? And if so, why in the world wasn't the staff informed much, much earlier? And how are we supposed to manage all this on such short notice, assuming it's not all just a wild goose chase?",3,en,gt_audios/155.wav
Questions,"Should I bring appetizers, drinks, or a dessert to the potluck?",0,en,gt_audios/156.wav
Questions,"Alright, honestly, I'm going a bit in circles here, so just to be absolutely sure I'm bringing the most useful thing, should I bring appetizers, drinks, or a dessert to the potluck? I know Sarah usually makes her amazing brownies, so dessert seems pretty well covered, doesn't it, and I'd really hate to double up unnecessarily, you know? In that case, would an appetizer genuinely be more helpful, or are you really, truly still short on drinks? Or perhaps, and please just give me a steer, is there something completely different, maybe something savory, that no one else has offered yet? Because if there is, would something like a large salad be appropriate, or were you thinking of something hot?",3,en,gt_audios/159.wav
Questions,"Was the presentation informative, engaging, or simply too long?",0,en,gt_audios/160.wav
Questions,"Okay, so, was the presentation genuinely informative and engaging, or was it, dare I say, just a tad too long? And, be honest now, did the presenter actually manage to handle those tricky questions effectively? More importantly, what, if anything, was the most surprising aspect for you? And given all that, do you foresee any real, practical applications emerging from it?",3,en,gt_audios/163.wav
Questions,"Did Professor Evans, the one with the tweed jacket, mention the assignment deadline?",0,en,gt_audios/164.wav
Questions,"Okay, look, I understand things get busy, but just so we're all absolutely certain, did Professor Evans—yes, the one with the rather memorable tweed jacket—did he explicitly announce the assignment deadline? Or are we genuinely still up in the air about that specific clarification? And if it turns out he hasn't actually said anything definitive, what then would be our most sensible plan to get that crucial information confirmed pretty quickly? I mean, surely there's a standard procedure for this, isn't there?",3,en,gt_audios/167.wav
Questions,"Are you, by any chance, related to the Hendersons from Maple Street?",0,en,gt_audios/168.wav
Questions,"Hang on a moment, are you seriously telling me you might be related to the Hendersons from Maple Street? Or, even more incredibly, could you possibly know their son, David, who used to live there? Because if that's the case, what are the odds, right? Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around that. And if you knew David, did you ever hear about his legendary treehouse escapades?",3,en,gt_audios/171.wav
Questions,"If the weather holds, shall we plan for a picnic in the park?",0,en,gt_audios/172.wav
Questions,"Alright, so, while I'm still not entirely sure if the weather will hold, let's just say for argument's sake it does, okay? In that scenario, do you genuinely still think we should plan for a picnic in the park? Or, being realistic, is it perhaps far better to definitively consider an indoor alternative now? And if it is indoors, what would be your absolute top choice, no hesitation? That's certainly a strong contender, especially given our current weather predicament. However, if we do opt for that, have we considered any potential backup plans if it's unexpectedly crowded?",3,en,gt_audios/175.wav
Questions,"Unless there are any objections, can we proceed with the vote now?",0,en,gt_audios/176.wav
Questions,"Alright, then, given that there are still apparently no further objections raised, we can finally proceed with the actual vote now, can we not? And, just so we are all on the exact same page, everyone is unequivocally clear on the precise motion being voted upon, are they? Or, and I do hope this isn't the case, does anyone at all perhaps still harbor some unvoiced, last-minute reservations before we commit? Because if there are any lingering uncertainties, however small, wouldn't it be best to articulate them now, rather than after the fact?",3,en,gt_audios/179.wav
Questions,How can you be so calm when everything is falling apart?,0,en,gt_audios/180.wav
Questions,"Look, I'm truly struggling to understand, how can you possibly remain so composed when everything is so blatantly disintegrating? Don't you perceive even a hint of the immense pressure here? It's simply... mind-boggling to observe. Could you, for goodness sake, just explain your underlying rationale? Or are you suggesting this is all perfectly normal somehow?",3,en,gt_audios/183.wav
Questions,What's the point of arguing about it now?,0,en,gt_audios/184.wav
Questions,"Okay, seriously, I'm struggling to grasp this: what on earth is the actual point of continuing this argument now? Couldn't we, and I mean really, just possibly accept the outcome and focus on moving forward? Or tell me, is there some obscure, hidden benefit to all this relentless back-and-forth that I'm completely failing to see? Because if there isn't one, aren't we just wasting everyone's time here?",3,en,gt_audios/187.wav
Questions,"Okay, let me rephrase: what exactly are you implying?",0,en,gt_audios/188.wav
Questions,"Alright, let's be absolutely clear then: what precisely is the implication you're driving at here? Because, frankly, your last statement was nothing short of intentionally obscure. So, are we genuinely dealing with a tangible assertion, or is this just more vague talk around the issue? And if it is a tangible assertion, what truly irrefutable proof can you actually provide to support it? Furthermore, if such proof exists, why has it not been forthcoming until this very moment?",3,en,gt_audios/191.wav
Questions,Did she honestly say 'It wasn't my fault' after causing the accident?,0,en,gt_audios/192.wav
Questions,"Okay, forgive my disbelief here, but I'm really trying to process this... are you genuinely, and I mean genuinely, telling me that after she demonstrably caused the accident, her immediate, unprompted response was 'It wasn't my fault'? And, if so, what fantastical explanation did she conjure up for that piece of audacity? Did anyone else hear her say this, or are we just relying on hearsay? And beyond that, what steps are being taken to formally document these conflicting claims?",3,en,gt_audios/195.wav
Questions,"Excuse me, is this seat taken?",0,en,gt_audios/196.wav
Questions,"Oh, excuse me, and I truly hope I'm not misreading the situation, but regarding this seat, is it definitively taken? It seemed so clearly unoccupied just a moment ago, you see, which makes me wonder; could they have only just stepped away briefly? And if so, would you happen to know if their return is expected quite imminently? Because, if not, would it be terribly presumptuous of me to sit here for a short while?",3,en,gt_audios/199.wav
Questions,"Pardon me, could you repeat the last part of that announcement?",0,en,gt_audios/200.wav
Questions,"Oh, goodness, I am terribly sorry, but I'm afraid I still couldn't quite make out the end of it; could you please, if it's not too much trouble, just quickly repeat the very last part of that announcement for me? And, most importantly, was there actually any mention of platform changes for the 3:15 train? Because I'm becoming increasingly concerned about getting to the right place on time, as I'm sure you can appreciate, can't you? And if there was such a mention, what exactly was the new platform assignment then?",3,en,gt_audios/203.wav
Questions,"Now, where did I leave my car keys this time?",0,en,gt_audios/204.wav
Questions,"You've got to be kidding me, again? Now where on earth could I possibly have left my car keys this time? And why, oh why, do I consistently do this to myself? Will I ever learn this lesson? Or am I just destined to wander around aimlessly looking for things forever?",3,en,gt_audios/207.wav
Questions,"Hmm, should I wear the blue tie or the red one?",0,en,gt_audios/208.wav
Questions,"Goodness, should I actually wear the blue tie or the red one? And more importantly, does this shirt even remotely go with either of them? What if I make the wrong choice? Could this decision actually ruin the entire evening, or am I just being overly dramatic?",3,en,gt_audios/211.wav
Questions,Are you absolutely certain this is the final version?,0,en,gt_audios/212.wav
Questions,"To be perfectly clear, are you absolutely certain this is the final version? Given that we've already submitted three previous drafts this week, is this particular one definitively approved for release, without any further amendments? And if so, could we get that confirmation in writing before we notify the other departments? The team is on standby, ready to proceed based on this. So, can we consider this matter fully closed once we have that written approval?",3,en,gt_audios/215.wav
Questions,"You double-checked the calculations, I hope?",0,en,gt_audios/216.wav
Questions,"Alright, look, for what feels like the tenth time, but is actually the third, you've definitely double-checked the calculations, right? Because, let's be brutally honest, if there's yet another mistake, are we even remotely prepared for the fallout that will inevitably ensue? Or are we just going to stand here and watch it all collapse again? This isn't a game we can afford to lose, you do realize that, don't you? So, what actual, concrete assurance can you offer me this time around?",3,en,gt_audios/219.wav
Questions,Well? Are you going to answer the question or just stand there?,0,en,gt_audios/220.wav
Questions,"Seriously, are you even going to attempt to answer the question, or are you content to just stand there mutely? Or could it be that you genuinely have no idea what the answer is? Is there any thought process happening at all? This prolonged silence is, quite frankly, becoming untenable. So, are we going to get an answer, or should I just assume the worst?",3,en,gt_audios/223.wav
Questions,How long do you estimate the repairs will take?,0,en,gt_audios/224.wav
Questions,"Okay, I appreciate that things can be unpredictable, but really, when you get right down to it, how long are we actually talking about for these repairs? And is that a genuinely firm estimate you're giving me, or is there a real chance it might stretch out quite a bit longer? Because, frankly, I need to know if I should start looking at alternative solutions, shouldn't I? This delay is causing significant planning issues for me. So, could you at least give me a definite deadline for a more concrete update if today's estimate is still vague?",3,en,gt_audios/227.wav
Questions,When did the policy regarding remote work officially change?,0,en,gt_audios/228.wav
Questions,"Look, I understand things get busy, but when precisely did the policy regarding remote work officially change? I've been looking for the email about it all morning, and honestly, it's becoming a bit of a blocker. Has anyone at all actually seen the official memo? Because it genuinely seems like nobody is quite sure, which is a little worrying. So, could we perhaps get a clear, unambiguous update in the next team meeting? And if not, what's the alternative for getting this confirmed promptly?",3,en,gt_audios/231.wav
Questions,Could this unexplained phenomenon be related to the earlier experiment?,0,en,gt_audios/232.wav
Questions,"Could this unexplained phenomenon be related to the earlier experiment? The control group, after all, showed no similar effects. Therefore, should we consider if there's an entirely different mechanism at play? That line of inquiry, of course, would take us into completely uncharted territory. So, what immediate adjustments to our experimental design would such a consideration necessitate? That would imply a complete re-evaluation of our foundational assumptions. And realistically, how long would such a re-evaluation take before we could even resume testing?",3,en,gt_audios/235.wav
Questions,May I suggest an alternative solution for consideration?,0,en,gt_audios/236.wav
Questions,"Forgive me for being persistent, but may I humbly suggest an alternative solution for consideration? We feel this new approach genuinely addresses several of the key concerns raised earlier. With that in mind, does it seem like a potentially viable path forward, or might there be other aspects we haven't fully considered? Or, if that's not quite right, could you perhaps point us towards the areas that still cause the most hesitation?",3,en,gt_audios/239.wav
Questions,"Considering the tight deadline, is this ambitious scope truly feasible?",0,en,gt_audios/240.wav
Questions,"Right, I've said I get the vision, truly I do, but seriously now, let's be utterly frank: considering this incredibly punishing deadline, is such a monumentally ambitious scope genuinely, truly feasible? Or wouldn't it be far more prudent, for the sake of actually delivering something of quality, to consider scaling back significantly? And if we insist on not scaling back, what on earth is the immediate, actionable plan B if—or more likely when—we smash into a major roadblock next week? Beyond that, has anyone even simulated the cascading failures if that plan B also falters?",3,en,gt_audios/243.wav
Questions,What possible justification could there be for such negligence?,0,en,gt_audios/244.wav
Questions,"Frankly, considering the entire chain of events, one must ask: what conceivable justification, if any, could possibly be offered for such blatant gross negligence, and are we, in all seriousness, now to understand this as the new, accepted standard? Furthermore, is it not imperative that someone, anyone, definitively clarify whether this represents a deliberate shift in official policy or is merely an egregious, and frankly alarming, oversight? And if it is an oversight, what concrete steps are being taken this very moment to rectify it and ensure it never happens again?",3,en,gt_audios/247.wav
Questions,Have all the necessary safety precautions been implemented?,0,en,gt_audios/248.wav
Questions,"Alright, I hear what the team's saying about completion, but frankly, to be unequivocally certain here: have all, and I mean all, necessary safety precautions been fully and verifiably implemented? And, perhaps even more critically, are we genuinely, without a shadow of a doubt, sure that every single conceivable contingency, down to the smallest detail, has been exhaustively addressed? Because if there's any lingering uncertainty, what, precisely, is our immediate, concrete plan to achieve that absolute level of confidence before we even think about moving forward? And who takes final sign-off responsibility for that comprehensive assurance?",3,en,gt_audios/251.wav
Questions,Does anyone here remember what the old procedure used to be?,0,en,gt_audios/252.wav
Questions,"Forgive me for pressing, but I'm genuinely trying to recall, does anyone here, by any chance, have a clear memory of what the old procedure actually entailed? We've been discussing this for a fair bit now and, frankly, it seems we're all struggling to recall the specifics. Might it be at all possible that someone could still have an old handbook, or perhaps even just a note from a training manual tucked away somewhere, that could clarify things definitively for us? Or, failing that, who would be the most appropriate person to kindly point us towards for retrieving such historical documents? And would that person likely be available this week, do you think?",3,en,gt_audios/255.wav
Questions,"Will the catering include vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options?",0,en,gt_audios/256.wav
Questions,"Okay, look, I really must stress this, it's becoming quite a concern for our guests' well-being: will the catering absolutely, without any possible doubt, include distinct vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options? And if, and only if, that's a firm yes, could you then please precisely clarify how these will be unequivocally distinguished from other items? Furthermore, are there truly any guarantees against cross-contamination for these highly specific dietary needs? And, just to be crystal clear, will there be a dedicated staff member available throughout the event to answer guest queries about these specific options?",3,en,gt_audios/259.wav
Questions,Who's responsible for coordinating the volunteer schedules?,0,en,gt_audios/260.wav
Questions,"Forgive my insistence, but who precisely is responsible for coordinating the volunteer schedules? We genuinely need to get this sorted out quickly, so could you confirm if there's a designated primary contact person we should all defer to for updates? And what's the expected timeframe for us to receive that confirmation? The current ambiguity is causing significant delays for everyone involved. Could we perhaps establish a temporary point person if a permanent one isn't immediately available?",3,en,gt_audios/263.wav
Questions,Perhaps we should take a short break before continuing?,0,en,gt_audios/264.wav
Questions,"You know, perhaps we really should consider taking a short break before continuing? My focus is definitely starting to wander more than a little, to be honest. Wouldn't a brief pause truly help everyone reset? I'm personally feeling the strain, and I genuinely believe a quick breather would be beneficial for everyone's productivity afterwards. So, really, are there any significant objections if we just pause for five short minutes then? Or is everyone actually quite happy to take that quick breather?",3,en,gt_audios/267.wav
Questions,Is it generally better to book flights far in advance or wait for last-minute deals?,0,en,gt_audios/268.wav
Questions,"Look, is it genuinely better to book flights way ahead of time, or should one gamble on those last-minute deals everyone talks about? And seriously, does picking one airline over another truly alter this whole game? It's the classic traveler's puzzle, right? So, once and for all, what's the real, expert advice here, if any definitive answer even exists? And could it be that there's no single answer because it depends entirely on unpredictable market whims?",3,en,gt_audios/271.wav
Questions,Why is effective communication so crucial in project management?,0,en,gt_audios/272.wav
Questions,"Look, I appreciate the overview, I really do, but I'm still trying to pinpoint exactly why effective communication is supposedly so uniquely critical in project management. And then, what fundamentally differentiates its importance there from its role in, for instance, standard operational procedures? Are we actually talking about entirely different communication paradigms, or is it just a matter of higher stakes, maybe even perceived higher stakes? And if it is perceived, wouldn't that shift the focus from inherent communication differences to perhaps managing stakeholder perceptions?",3,en,gt_audios/275.wav
Questions,Can you believe how much the city skyline has changed in just ten years?,0,en,gt_audios/276.wav
Questions,"Honestly, it's rather unsettling, can you really believe how much the city skyline has changed in just ten years? It almost feels like a different place entirely, and frankly, not necessarily for the better, doesn't it? I mean, the sheer scale of the transformation is just mind-boggling. Do you ever genuinely worry if it's all happening too fast? And what if we're overlooking some crucial long-term impacts?",3,en,gt_audios/279.wav
